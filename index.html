                    Last Christmas <br>
                    Oooohhhh<br>
                    Oh<br>
                    <br>
                    Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                    But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                    This year, to save me from tears,<br>
                    I'll give it to someone special<br>
                    <br>
                    Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                    But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                    (You gave it away)<br>
                    This year, to save me from tears,<br>
                    I'll give it to someone special<br>
                    (Special)<br>
                    <br>
                    Once bitten and twice shy<br>
                    I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
                    Tell me baby, do you recognize me?<br>
                    Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
                    <br>
                    ("Merry Christmas") I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
                    With a note saying "I love you", I meant it<br>
                    Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
                    But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
                    <br>
                    Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                    But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                    (You gave it away)<br>
                    This year, to save me from tears,<br>
                    I'll give it to someone special<br>
                    (Special)<br>

                    Oh oh baby<br>
                    <br>
                    A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
                    I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
                    My god, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                    Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
                    <br>
                    A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                    A man under cover but you tore me apart<br>
                    Oh oh now I've found a real love<br>
                    You'll never fool me again<br>
                    <br>
                    Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>

                    <br>
                    (Last Christmas I gave you my heart) Gave you my heart<br>
                    (But the very next day) You gave me away (you gave it away)<br>
                    (This year, to save me from tears)<br>
                    (I'll give it to someone special)<br>

                    (A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
                    Maybe next year<br>
                    I'll give it to someone<br>
                    I'll give it to someone<br>
                    Special)<br>
                    Special<br>
